journal.document.adventurers_guide.intro.title=Active Functionalities
journal.document.adventurers_guide.intro.body=SAAAA-LUUU-TATIONS!\n\nYou're reading our incredible final report!(Sorry for the RWBY reference, had to include it) This report has all of the MUST KNOWS of this app! We'll start by listing functionalities explained in video.\nTo begin with, the gameplay shall let the player move, attack, pick up and use objects. All of this done through simple Taps. Also, there's a combat system with equipment, damage and healing calculations, multiple effects and some nasty critters(and NPCs) wanting to kill you (Or help)\nAdditionally, it's important to know that the buttons work to open your inventory, read this report(or compendiums) or investigate/wait to "burn turns" or get some spicy secrets.\nNext page shall talk about configuration functionalities! Onwards to VICTORY!
journal.document.adventurers_guide.identifying.title=Configuration Functionalities
journal.document.adventurers_guide.identifying.body=The functionalities outside of the game are as important as the gameplay!\n\nWe'll start with the base ones, being a roguelike each tun is different and objects, effects and even the color of potions changes thanks to the whims of randomizers.\n\nNow, configurations are VITAL. So, the game has a pause menu including: configurations, main menu option, exit game or return to it.(Or start a new one if you DIE), configuration lets you change how the game looks or enable energy saving mode, likewise, it lets you change the audio or UI. The other features are shown on the main menu.\nOn the main menu, you are able to see your rankings(How far you got on each run), badges(Achievements of a kind), a changelog, an "about", connection with Google Play, an option to change languages and donations.\n\nFinally, the option to enter the Gungeon(Sorry, wrong game) has the option to continue saved runs or start a new one letting the player select a class amongst four. \n\n These are all the functionalities found on this app. We hope you liked this first part of the report.
journal.document.adventurers_guide.examining_and_searching.title=Code 1: Android
journal.document.adventurers_guide.examining_and_searching.body=How this code is organized is really important. Like eating is for puny humans!\n\nInitially, it must be taken into account that this project's codes are divided into two big sites: A folder called "core" that has over 100 classes and the Android folder of the common classes of Android Studio. This entry shall focus on the last folder.\n\nThis folder contains the game, the launcher and the platform support alongside the windows and text input of the game. That means that these classes are what is directly connected to Android and is what lets the game play!\n\nThe most important thing on this folder is that it creates a redrawable canvas on which the actual game works. Additionally, this links to the actual game's classes, observing the changes and modifying the views according to the calculations of the game.
journal.document.adventurers_guide.strength.title=Code 2: Core
journal.document.adventurers_guide.strength.body=The second file contains the code outside of the runnable of Android Studio proper. This folder, which may or may not be a modified version of the Orginal Pixel Dungeon, works as a base library to execute the whole game.\n\nThis folder,Core, is the one that contains everything needed to actually run the game. The Assets, for example, are in this folder. Another good example is the files from which we write this report.\n\nBut the most important thing is the use of code on this folder. The Source defines the code and, to do so, divides it in 15 folders and multiple files outside of them for its execution.\n\nIn general, the external files work to load assets whilst the ones inside folders carry the logic like black men carry coffins while dancing. \n The logic, in general, is based upon decorators like when the hero gets his class and level ups, a mob becomes his specific type, etc. Additionally, the UI is modified here and the levels are created by randomizers who are still more predictable than my ex, being this most of the general code.
journal.document.adventurers_guide.food.title=Code 3: Libraries
journal.document.adventurers_guide.food.body=To begin with, this game requires a library created by the original game's creator(Which has no name), this one helps bind the calculations and basic shows of the game plus helping with compatibility.\n\nThe other libraries are not used on Core but on the Android folder files. Let's read more about them, shall we?\n\nWe may only see three libraries on this game: Nameless, the Core itself and badlogic, this library works to configure the project to run on Android Studio since, originally, it only worked on IntelliJ. \n\nThis pretty much wraps up our code analysis. Together with their Youtube Videos, this should work out to give you a great understanding of the code. See you next time while we will show eventual connectivity and may try to conquer this world with it.
journal.document.adventurers_guide.levelling.title=Eventual Connectivity
journal.document.adventurers_guide.levelling.body=Eventual Connectivity in this game is only seen in two cases(Like my dad):\n\nThe first one is Google Play Services, this has its Eventual Connectivity services that work as a black box. In this game, it works as a deferred save, being useful to play the game on multiple devices. In case of not having connection, waits until it has it and then sends the data to the server.\n\n On the other side, the other thing is when you try to donate to the creators. It has a message that gives basically 0 data saying that you have no connection without giving any reasons.
journal.document.adventurers_guide.surprise_attacks.title=Performance 1
journal.document.adventurers_guide.surprise_attacks.body=One of the best ways to get the upper hand in combat is with surprise attacks.\n\nA surprise attack occurs whenever you attack an enemy while you are out of their sight, or right as you come into view. Even the most evasive of enemies can't dodge a surprise attack!\n\nOne of the most common parts of the environment you can use to surprise enemies is a door. An enemy will be open to a surprise attack right as they move through a closed door.\n\n(When you successfully land a surprise attack, a yellow exclamation mark will briefly appear ontop of the enemy you just struck)
journal.document.adventurers_guide.dieing.title=Performance 2
journal.document.adventurers_guide.dieing.body=If a situation is looking grim, there's no shame in running away. Escaping to another part of the dungeon can give you some time to recover before trying again.\n\nUnfortunately, dungeoneering is a very dangerous profession and most adventurers will eventually meet their demise. While luck can definitely play a role, the best adventurers are the ones who use every little trick to improve their odds.\n\n(Don't be dissuaded if you are dying a lot. You shouldn't expect to get very far in your first few tries, this game is hard! Focus on learning the game and steadily improving, don't focus on winning right away.)
journal.document.adventurers_guide.looting.title=Threads
journal.document.adventurers_guide.looting.body=Specific rooms will often contain better loot than others. Some of these rooms will be behind locked doors, or will contain obstacles which must be navigated past.\n\nWhenever an obstacle like this blocks your progress, look for a solution nearby. Whether it's a key or something more crafty, there is usually a tool you can use on the same floor.\n\nPotions of strength and scrolls of upgrade are an excellent measure of how well you're exploring and looting. You will be able to find 3 scrolls of upgrade and 2 potions of strength per dungeon region.\n\n(You can see a list of important landmarks and unused keys in the notes tab of the journal window.)
journal.document.adventurers_guide.magic.title=Our Mods
journal.document.adventurers_guide.magic.body=Magical attacks cut right through armor and are extremely difficult to dodge.\n\nThis means that damage you deal with wands will be very reliable, but also makes magical enemies extremely dangerous.\n\nMagical attacks always have a caveat though. In the case of wands it's their limited charges, wands become almost useless if they aren't given time to recharge. Magic that enemies use will always have some form of weakness as well. \n\nWhen facing enemies that use magic it is extremely important to figure out how to evade their magic, rather than just eating the damage from it.

journal.document.alchemy_guide.title=Alchemy Guide
journal.document.alchemy_guide.potions.title=Creating Potions
journal.document.alchemy_guide.potions.body=Welcome to Practical Applications of Alchemy!\n\nThis book serves as a recipe reference for hobbyist alchemists and adventurers looking to get their hands dirty.\n\nWe will start with the most iconic alchemy recipe: Place any three seeds into an alchemy pot to brew a random potion!\n\nEvery seed has a potion counterpart, and the potion you create may relate to one of the seeds used. Using multiple of the same seed will increase the chance for this to occur.
journal.document.alchemy_guide.stones.title=Creating Runestones
journal.document.alchemy_guide.stones.body=Mixing a scroll into an alchemy pot will imbue its magic into two or three rocks within the pot. This creates runestones!
journal.document.alchemy_guide.energy_food.title=Energy and Food
journal.document.alchemy_guide.energy_food.body=Some recipes require energy from the alchemy pot itself. Energy is used in recipes that produce more than the sum of their ingredients.\n\nNot all energy recipes are especially mystical however. These recipes more resemble traditional cooking than alchemy.
journal.document.alchemy_guide.bombs.title=Enhanced Bombs
journal.document.alchemy_guide.bombs.body=A standard black powder bomb can be mixed with a specific item to create an enhanced bomb.
journal.document.alchemy_guide.exotic_potions.title=Exotic Potions
journal.document.alchemy_guide.exotic_potions.body=Potions can be augmented with two seeds to create exotic potions. They have more powerful effects, but are often useful in different ways.
journal.document.alchemy_guide.exotic_scrolls.title=Exotic Scrolls
journal.document.alchemy_guide.exotic_scrolls.body=Exotic scrolls can be made with two runestones and a scroll. They're a bit stronger than exotic potions, but stones are also harder to come by.
journal.document.alchemy_guide.catalysts.title=Catalysts
journal.document.alchemy_guide.catalysts.body=Catalysts are made by combining a scroll or potion with a single seed or runestone. If the pair of items match, the alchemical energy cost is reduced.\n\nCatalysts are most useful as components in recipes covered in the next two pages, but also can be used in a pinch for a random effect.
journal.document.alchemy_guide.brews_elixirs.title=Brews and Elixirs
journal.document.alchemy_guide.brews_elixirs.body=Brews and elixirs are advanced potions which provide a variety of effects with a single use.
journal.document.alchemy_guide.spells.title=Spells
journal.document.alchemy_guide.spells.body=Spells are contained in crystals and provide a variety of effects with multiple uses.
